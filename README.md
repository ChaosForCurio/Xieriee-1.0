Next.js Project Overview

This project was initialized using create-next-app
 and follows the recommended Next.js App Router structure.

🚀 Getting Started

Start the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev


Once the server is running, open http://localhost:3000
 in your browser.

You can begin customizing the app by editing app/page.tsx. Changes will automatically reflect in real-time thanks to Next.js’ fast refresh.

This project also uses next/font
 to automatically load and optimize Geist, Vercel’s modern font family.
